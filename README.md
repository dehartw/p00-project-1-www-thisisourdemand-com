# P00: Project 1
*Our initial device idea is: a light, audio, and motion sensor to control light brightness.*
*LightBright for short*

## Purpose
*plugs into an outlet and lets the lights/lamp plug into it. it has a sensor that senses how much light is in it's
area of the room and adjusts the light acordingly. the goal is to have three or four of these in a room and have
them talk to each other so that they all turn off, on or other comands through audio. the product will have differnt
modes as well, one for even brightness and another for motion sensor dimming. the motion sensor dimming mode would 
increase the light while you are near differnet lamps. the motion sensor dimming mode would save electricity while the perfect brightness mode can be asthetic*


## Initial Design Plan
*You'll complete this section as part of Milestone 1, and update regularly.*

Outline the product you're creating:
- List the hardware components you'll be using, and how they interact. 
  This is an appropriate place for a diagram. An EXCELLENT resource 
  for creating diagrams is the [Fritzing website](http://fritzing.org/home/ "Fritzing website")
- List all of the known parts in the code you'll be creating.
  - Your program must follow good coding standards. 
  Primarily, I mean your code should include meaningful functions 
  and appropriate variables, and be formatted and commented well. 
  Sloppy code with no structure will be penalized
